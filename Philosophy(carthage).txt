When we talk about a reimbursement manager, we are really talking about Trust & Trustworthiness
We are talking about a way to manage drivers based on Trustworthiness
And when we ask/tell drivers to spend money, and that we will reimburse them for their expenses
We are asking them to trust us
Managers need a way to track trustworthiness
Employees need a system that maintains and increments Trust
This is what we are now going to build

All code for the project including the sql script is in the Carthage folder. 
I made the tables but chose to do all initial inserts through the java instead of in the sql script.
Feels like the right decision, we'll see how it goes.
